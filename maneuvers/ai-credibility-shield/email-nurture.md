Subject: Your dental content audit is ready (and you should see this)

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for downloading the content audit checklist. I'm guessing you either:

1. You're using DoctorLogic or Tebra and wondering why your new patient leads are flat
2. You're evaluating them and want to know if they actually work
3. You're with a freelancer/agency and suspect your content isn't as strong as it should be

All three scenarios have a common question underneath: **Is my dental content actually good?**

Here's the fastest way to find out.

**Open the audit checklist you just downloaded.** Go through your top 5 blog posts and ask:

- Could these posts be about ANY dentist, or are they specifically about YOUR practice?
- Does the structure match your competitors' posts (identical subheadings, identical flow)?
- Could a ChatGPT prompt have generated this?

If 3 out of 5 of your blog posts feel "generic," you likely have an AI-content problem.

**Here's why this matters:** Google's algorithm updates in 2024-2025 penalized low-effort, unedited AI content. Practices using DoctorLogic or generic AI tools saw 40-60% organic traffic drops. Not small declines. Career-changing declines.

At the same time, practices with human-written, expert-reviewed content either stayed flat or grew.

The gap is widening. And if your audit shows you're in the "AI-generated commodity" bucket, the next 12 months are going to be painful.

**Next step:** Reply to this email with your top challenge. Are you:
- A DoctorLogic/Tebra customer seeing results plateau?
- Evaluating platforms and want to know which are actually sustainable?
- Currently happy but want to make sure you're not exposed?

I can offer a 15-minute quick audit of your specific situation—no strings, no sales pitch. Just clarity.

Talk soon,

P.S. — If your audit shows you have a lot of commodity AI content, don't panic. Most practices do. The ones winning in 2026 are the ones who recognized it early and made a change. We can help.

Subject: Why your newest competitor is beating you

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up on the content audit.

I want to show you something that most dental practice owners don't see until it's too late.

We just analyzed a market where a new dentist (literally 18 months in practice) is outranking a 15-year practice. The new dentist is getting more organic new patient leads, better conversion rates, and spending less on paid ads.

The older practice is spending $4,000/month on DoctorLogic and Google Ads. The newer practice is spending $800/month, and most of that is reinvestment, not desperation.

What's the difference?

**It's not the size of the content library.** The established practice has 80+ blog posts. The new practice has 35.

**It's not AI-generated content.** Both have content (though the new practice's is human-written, the established practice's is AI-generated).

**It's not a better website.** Actually, the established practice's website is slicker.

**It's compounding SEO.**

Here's what happened:

The new practice spent 18 months writing *specific, expert, patient-focused content* about the exact challenges their patients face. Each piece built on previous work. Each piece accumulated backlinks, shares, and Google's trust.

The established practice spent the last 18 months pumping out *generic, AI-generated content* through DoctorLogic. Fast volume. No specificity. No compounding effect. Each post competed with 1,000 identical competitor posts.

Result: the new practice's 35 pieces of authentic content outrank the established practice's 80 pieces of commodity content.

**This is the 2026 reality of dental marketing.**

Speed ≠ strength. Volume ≠ authority. AI ≠ trust.

The practices beating you aren't necessarily older or bigger. They're just building content that compounds.

**Here's the painful part:** If you're currently with DoctorLogic, Tebra, or a generic AI platform, switching costs real money (new platform, rewriting content, rebuilding your content strategy). The urge is to stay the course and hope it works.

But the math is against you. Every month you wait, the gap widens.

**What can you do right now?**

1. Finish the audit from Email 1. Identify your weakest content.
2. Replace the bottom 30% with human-expert content over the next 90 days.
3. See if new patient leads improve.

If they do, you know the direction. Double down on human expertise over AI-generated volume.

If you want to fast-track this audit and build a 90-day action plan specific to your practice, I'm offering a free strategy call. No pitch. No obligation. Just a clear roadmap based on your actual competitive position.

P.S. — The new practice I mentioned isn't some SEO unicorn. They're just using the approach that actually works: human expertise, patient focus, consistent effort over time. Any practice can do this. Most don't, because it's slower than the AI promise. But the ones that do win.

Hi [First Name],

Last email in this sequence, but I want to leave you with the most important difference between ekwa and platforms like DoctorLogic or Tebra.

**It's not our technology. It's our people.**

Here's how most dental marketing platforms work:

You sign up. You get a dashboard. Your "account manager" is 3 people serving 200+ practices. Your content is generated by AI. Your ads are templated. Your website is one of 500 similar templates.

You're a customer. Not a practice. Not a partner. A customer with a recurring subscription.

**Here's how ekwa works:**

You get one dedicated expert—an actual dental marketing specialist (not a generalist, not an AI) who:

- Understands your practice, your market, and your patients
- Writes or edits every piece of content with your voice in mind
- Knows your competitors by name and your patients' actual objections
- Shows up for a monthly call (not a quarterly business review with a PowerPoint)
- Sleeps better when your practice grows, and worse when you're struggling

This expert isn't managing 200 practices. They're managing 5-8, depending on complexity. That's how we know you.

**Why does this matter?**

Because when Google's algorithm shifts (which it does every quarter), we don't push a software update. We strategize with you about what it means for your specific practice.

When you say "we're seeing a lot of questions about cosmetic bonding but no content on it," we don't queue it in a content calendar. We talk about why, who's asking, what the misconceptions are, and how to position YOUR approach.

When your new patient leads are down, we don't give you a dashboard showing "traffic is down." We dig in. We audit. We figure out if it's a content problem, a conversion problem, a pricing problem, or something else entirely.

**That's the human advantage.**

It costs more than DoctorLogic. You already know that. But the ROI isn't measured in clicks or impressions. It's measured in new patients who actually trust you and show up.

**The invitation:**

If you're ready to see what working with a real team (not a platform, not a freelancer, not an AI) actually looks like, let's talk.

I'm offering a free 30-minute consultation where we:

1. Audit your current content and competitive position (15 min)
2. Identify your biggest opportunity in the next 90 days (10 min)
3. Talk about what it would look like to work together (5 min)

No pitch. No pressure. Just a real conversation about whether ekwa is a fit for your practice.

P.S. — If you're happy with your current marketing situation, awesome. Seriously. But if you're seeing results plateau, organic leads dry up, or you're wondering if there's a better way... we should talk. The practices we work with usually spend the first 3 months wondering why they didn't switch sooner.
