## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Situation

[Group Name] operates [X] dental locations across [Region/States], generating approximately [$$M] in annual practice revenue. Currently, your marketing is managed through [#] separate agencies/vendors, each working independently on:
- Local SEO
- Website management
- Advertising
- Social media
- Reputation management

This fragmented approach has created:
1. **Brand Inconsistency** – Each location has a different voice, messaging, and positioning
2. **No Unified Reporting** – Leadership lacks a single view of marketing performance across all locations
3. **Budget Inefficiency** – Total monthly spend is [$X], but with overlapping services and no consolidation discount
4. **Team Burden** – Your internal team manages multiple vendor relationships, timelines, and contracts

### Opportunity

By consolidating your marketing under a single partner (ekwa), you can:
- **Reduce monthly spend by 30–40%** (from $[X]/month to $[X]/month)
- **Gain unified performance visibility** (one dashboard, all locations, all metrics)
- **Strengthen brand consistency** while optimizing for local market presence
- **Cut internal management time by 60%** (one trusted partner, not five vendors)
- **Unlock scalable growth** (playbook extends seamlessly as you add locations)

### Recommendation

Implement ekwa's **DSO Integrated Marketing Program** for 12 months, with the following scope:
- Local SEO strategy & optimization per location
- Unified brand messaging & content calendar
- Google Business Profile management at scale
- Paid search & social media management
- Reputation management across all locations
- Unified monthly reporting & quarterly strategy reviews
- Dedicated account team

**Investment:** $[ASP per month] (pricing shown in detail below)
**Contract Term:** 12 months (auto-renews month 13 unless 60-day notice)

## PART 2: ekwa's DSO SOLUTION

### Philosophy

**"Enterprise Intelligence, Boutique Execution"**

We are not a software platform pretending to do marketing. We are not five different agencies creating chaos. We are **one dedicated team**, exclusive to your group, managing local growth at scale.

### Our Approach

#### 1. Unified Brand Strategy

**What we do:**
- Develop a unified brand positioning for [Group Name] that applies across all locations

## PART 3: COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

### Why ekwa Wins for DSOs

#### 1. Exclusivity (Nobody Else in the Market Has This)

We commit to **one DSO group per geographic region**. This means:
- We will never work with your competitors
- All our strategy & learnings are optimized for YOU
- No conflicts of interest
- When your group grows, we grow with you

**vs. Enterprise Platforms:** PatientPop/Tebra work with 100+ practices per market. Your strategy is generic.
**vs. Multiple Agencies:** Each agency has conflicting priorities. No one is optimizing for your group's overall success.

#### 2. Dental-Only Expertise (16+ Years)

We've been doing this since 2008. We understand:
- Insurance & patient financial pressures
- Hygiene scheduling & team efficiency
- Treatment acceptance challenges
- What actually drives new patient value (not just volume)
- How to market services your practices actually profit from

**vs. Enterprise Platforms:** Healthcare-generic approach doesn't understand dental nuances.
**vs. Single-practice agencies:** They know their location. We know the entire market + multi-location dynamics.

#### 3. Local + Unified (The Goldilocks Approach)

Each location gets:
- Hyper-local SEO, GBP management, local content
- Community-specific marketing

But under a unified strategy:
- Consistent brand voice
- Unified reporting & attribution
- Centralized account team
- Coordinated campaigns

**vs. Enterprise Platforms:** One-size-fits-all templates, no local optimization.
**vs. Multiple agencies:** Each doing their own thing, zero coordination.

#### 4. Human Experts, Not Black Box Software

You work with real people who understand your business:
- Dedicated account team
- Quarterly strategy reviews
- Direct line to specialists
- Strategic partnership, not vendor relationship

**vs. Enterprise Platforms:** AI-driven, algorithm-based, limited human touch.
**vs. Multiple agencies:** Fragmented relationships, no overall strategy.

#### 5. Pricing Built for Your Size

You're too big for single-practice pricing, too specific for enterprise pricing. Our model is designed for you:
- Per-location pricing (transparent, scales with growth)
- Volume discounts as you grow
- No surprise fees
- 30–50% cheaper than enterprise platforms
