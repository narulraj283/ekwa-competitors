# ekwa DSO ROI Calculator
## Framework for Demonstrating Marketing Investment Impact

---

## HOW TO USE THIS CALCULATOR

This calculator helps DSO prospects understand the potential ROI of consolidating their marketing with ekwa. It's designed to:
1. Use their **actual current situation** (locations, spend, new patients)
2. Apply **conservative, moderate, and aggressive growth scenarios**
3. Show **clear math** they can verify with their own numbers
4. Demonstrate **payback period** and **Year 1 profit**

### Before Your Call

Ask the prospect (via email or initial call):
- How many locations do they have?
- What's their current total monthly marketing spend?
- What's their average new patient value?
- How many new patients/month do they currently acquire?

Then **fill in the calculator with their numbers** before the strategy call or proposal meeting.

## CALCULATOR: YEAR 1 INVESTMENT ANALYSIS

### SECTION 1: YOUR CURRENT SITUATION

| Item | Value | Formula/Source |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Number of Locations** | [#] | Direct from prospect |
| **Current Total Monthly Marketing Spend** | $[X] | Sum of all agencies/vendors |
| **Avg Monthly New Patients (all locations)** | [#] | Prospect's CRM/practice mgmt data |
| **Avg New Patient Value (lifetime)** | $[X] | Conservative: 4-year relationship avg |
| **Current Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)** | $[Y] | Divide: Current spend ÷ new patients |

**Example Row:**
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Number of Locations | 6 |
| Current Total Monthly Marketing Spend | $7,000 |
| Avg Monthly New Patients | 25 |
| Avg New Patient Value (lifetime) | $2,400 |
| Current Cost Per Acquisition | $280 |

---

### SECTION 2: ekwa PRICING FOR YOUR GROUP

Based on your location count, determine your tier:

| Tier | Locations | Per-Location/Month | Your Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| **Starter** | 3–5 | $1,800 | — | — |
| **Growth** | 6–10 | $1,500 | **$[X]** | **$[Y]** |
| **Scale** | 11–15 | $1,200 | — | — |

**Example:**
- 6 locations × $1,500/month = $9,000/month = $108,000/year

---

### SECTION 3: COST COMPARISON

#### Current Spend vs. ekwa Investment

| Category | Current Annual | ekwa Annual | Annual Savings | % Savings |
|----------|----------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Total Marketing Investment** | $[Current × 12] | $[ekwa annual] | $[Difference] | [%] |

**Example:**
| Category | Current Annual | ekwa Annual | Annual Savings | % Savings |
|----------|----------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Total Marketing Investment | $84,000 | $108,000 | $(24,000) | -28.6% |

*Note: Prospect is paying MORE upfront because ekwa is adding Paid Search + Social + Reputation (services they weren't getting before, or were fragmented). This is expected.*

---

### SECTION 4: NEW PATIENT GROWTH SCENARIOS

ekwa typically helps DSO groups grow new patients by **15–50%** depending on market maturity, current state, and execution. Below are three scenarios.

#### CONSERVATIVE SCENARIO: 15% New Patient Growth

Assumes: Moderate market maturity, existing good foundation, focus on efficiency gains.

| Metric | Current | Projected Year 1 | Calculation |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Monthly New Patients** | [#] | [# + 15%] | [#] × 1.15 |
| **Annual New Patients** | [# × 12] | [# × 12 × 1.15] | — |
| **Additional New Patients (Year 1)** | — | [# × 1.8] | 15% of annual |
| **Revenue from New Patients** | — | $[#] | Additional patients × avg value |
| **ekwa Investment (Year 1)** | — | $[Annual cost] | From Section 2 |
| **Net Profit (Year 1)** | — | $[Revenue - Investment] | Revenue - Investment |
| **Payback Period** | — | [# months] | Investment ÷ (monthly new revenue) |
| **ROI %** | — | [%] | (Net Profit ÷ Investment) × 100 |

**Example: Conservative (15% Growth)**

| Metric | Current | Projected Year 1 | Calculation |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Monthly New Patients | 25 | 29 | 25 × 1.15 |
| Annual New Patients | 300 | 345 | — |
| Additional New Patients (Year 1) | — | 45 | 300 × 0.15 |
| Revenue from New Patients | — | $108,000 | 45 × $2,400 |
| ekwa Investment (Year 1) | — | $108,000 | Exactly breaks even |
| Net Profit (Year 1) | — | $0 | $108K - $108K |
| Payback Period | — | 12 months | Exactly at year end |
| ROI % | — | 0% | Break-even scenario |

**Key Insight:** At 15% growth, Year 1 is break-even (you paid the same amount as you earned back). But Year 2+ is pure profit because you keep the new patients.

---

#### MODERATE SCENARIO: 30% New Patient Growth

Assumes: Underserved market, significant room for optimization, strong execution from ekwa + prospect team.

| Metric | Current | Projected Year 1 | Calculation |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Monthly New Patients** | [#] | [# + 30%] | [#] × 1.30 |
| **Annual New Patients** | [# × 12] | [# × 12 × 1.30] | — |
| **Additional New Patients (Year 1)** | — | [# × 3.6] | 30% of annual |
| **Revenue from New Patients** | — | $[#] | Additional patients × avg value |
| **ekwa Investment (Year 1)** | — | $[Annual cost] | From Section 2 |
| **Net Profit (Year 1)** | — | $[Revenue - Investment] | Revenue - Investment |
| **Payback Period** | — | [# months] | Investment ÷ (monthly new revenue) |
| **ROI %** | — | [%] | (Net Profit ÷ Investment) × 100 |

**Example: Moderate (30% Growth)**

| Metric | Current | Projected Year 1 | Calculation |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Monthly New Patients | 25 | 32.5 | 25 × 1.30 |
| Annual New Patients | 300 | 390 | — |
| Additional New Patients (Year 1) | — | 90 | 300 × 0.30 |
| Revenue from New Patients | — | $216,000 | 90 × $2,400 |
| ekwa Investment (Year 1) | — | $108,000 | From tier calculation |
| Net Profit (Year 1) | — | $108,000 | $216K - $108K |
| Payback Period | — | 6 months | $108K ÷ $18K monthly new revenue |
| ROI % | — | 100% | ($108K ÷ $108K) × 100 |

**Key Insight:** At 30% growth, you break even in 6 months and pocket $108K profit in Year 1. This is the "typical" scenario for most DSO clients.

---

#### AGGRESSIVE SCENARIO: 50% New Patient Growth

Assumes: Highly competitive market with untapped opportunity, significant current inefficiency, strong team execution.

| Metric | Current | Projected Year 1 | Calculation |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Monthly New Patients** | [#] | [# + 50%] | [#] × 1.50 |
| **Annual New Patients** | [# × 12] | [# × 12 × 1.50] | — |
| **Additional New Patients (Year 1)** | — | [# × 6] | 50% of annual |
| **Revenue from New Patients** | — | $[#] | Additional patients × avg value |
| **ekwa Investment (Year 1)** | — | $[Annual cost] | From Section 2 |
| **Net Profit (Year 1)** | — | $[Revenue - Investment] | Revenue - Investment |
| **Payback Period** | — | [# months] | Investment ÷ (monthly new revenue) |
| **ROI %** | — | (Net Profit ÷ Investment) × 100 |

**Example: Aggressive (50% Growth)**

| Metric | Current | Projected Year 1 | Calculation |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Monthly New Patients | 25 | 37.5 | 25 × 1.50 |
| Annual New Patients | 300 | 450 | — |
| Additional New Patients (Year 1) | — | 150 | 300 × 0.50 |
| Revenue from New Patients | — | $360,000 | 150 × $2,400 |
| ekwa Investment (Year 1) | — | $108,000 | From tier calculation |
| Net Profit (Year 1) | — | $252,000 | $360K - $108K |
| Payback Period | — | 3.6 months | $108K ÷ $30K monthly new revenue |
| ROI % | — | 233% | ($252K ÷ $108K) × 100 |

**Key Insight:** At 50% growth, you break even in less than 4 months and generate $252K profit in Year 1. This is the upside case for groups in highly competitive markets with poor baseline marketing.

---

## SECTION 5: MULTI-YEAR PROJECTION

Once you have Year 1 numbers, Year 2+ looks even better because you keep the new patients (lower churn assumption: 80% of new Year 1 patients stay):

### Example: Year 2–3 Projection (Moderate Scenario, 30% growth)

| Year | New Patients Acquired | Cumulative Patient Base | Investment | Revenue | Cumulative Profit |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| **Year 0 (Current)** | 300 | 300 | $84,000 | — | — |
| **Year 1** | 390 (+30%) | 690 | $108,000 | $216,000 | +$108,000 |
| **Year 2** | 390 (+30% on Year 2 base) | 1,080 | $108,000 | $216,000 + $240,000* | +$348,000 |
| **Year 3** | 390 (+30% on Year 3 base) | 1,470 | $108,000 | $216,000 + $240,000 + $300,000* | +$648,000 |

*Assumes retained patients from prior years also generate lifetime value (hygiene visits, treatment, referrals)

**Insight:** By Year 3, your cumulative profit is $648K—more than 6x your annual ekwa investment.

---

## SECTION 6: ADDITIONAL BENEFITS (HARDER TO QUANTIFY)

Beyond new patient revenue, consider these secondary benefits:

### 1. Internal Team Time Savings

**Current State:** Marketing team spends 40% of time managing 5 different vendors
**With ekwa:** One vendor relationship, 60% time reduction

**Value Calculation:**
- Hours saved/month: [# of marketing staff] × 40% × 160 hours/month
- Hourly cost: [avg loaded cost = salary ÷ 2,080 hours/year]
- Annual savings: Hours saved × hourly cost

**Example:**
- 1 FTE marketing person (salary $60K) = $30/hour loaded cost
- Hours freed: 64 hours/month × 12 = 768 hours/year
- Value: 768 × $30 = **$23,040/year in redirected effort**

---

### 2. Brand Consistency Value

Unified brand across locations typically increases conversion by 10–15%.

**Conservative Calculation:**
- Current annual patients acquired: 300
- Conversion improvement: 10% of current (not growth, but efficiency)
- Additional patients from better conversion: 30
- Revenue: 30 × $2,400 = **$72,000/year**

---

### 3. Operational Efficiency (Vendor Management)

**Cost of maintaining 5 different vendors:**
- Contract negotiations & management: 20 hours/year
- Invoice reconciliation: 40 hours/year
- Performance meetings: 60 hours/year
- Onboarding & offboarding: 40 hours/year
- Total: 160 hours/year

At $50/hour (mixed cost): **$8,000/year in avoided operational friction**

---

### 4. Marketing Attribution Clarity

**Benefit:** Better understanding of which marketing activities drive new patients

Can lead to 15–20% better budget allocation and reduced waste. Not easily quantified, but material.

---

## SECTION 7: RISK MITIGATION & ASSUMPTIONS

### Assumptions Built Into This Model

1. **30% growth is realistic** for DSO groups consolidating fragmented marketing
   - Based on actual client results (conservative)
   - Assumes dedicated execution from both ekwa and prospect
   - Assumes no major market disruption

2. **New patient value is $2,400** (4-year lifetime)
   - Adjust based on practice type (cosmetic dental = higher)
   - Cosmetic/implant-focused: $3,500–$5,000
   - General family: $1,800–$2,400
   - Pediatric: $1,200–$1,800

3. **Current spend is accurate**
   - Ask prospect to sum all current marketing vendors/spend
   - Many groups underestimate fragmented spend

4. **80% retention of new patients**
   - Realistic assumption for well-run practices
   - Adjust if practice has known retention challenges

### Downside Risk Scenarios

**What if growth is only 15% (Conservative Scenario)?**
- Year 1 is break-even
- Year 2+ becomes profitable as patients remain
- Still worth it for brand consistency & reporting alone

**What if we're wrong and growth is 0%?**
- Unlikely if execution is strong
- Even in worst case, unified reporting & internal time savings (~$30K/year) offset most of investment
- Plus: No price increase from ekwa (if growth underperforms, you didn't overpay)

**What if the prospect loses locations?**
- Pricing adjusts down prorated
- No penalty for removing locations
- Money follows the actual business

## SECTION 8: HOW TO PRESENT THIS TO A PROSPECT

### The Conversation Flow

1. **Gather their numbers** (before the call)
   - Locations, spend, new patients, patient value

2. **Walk through Section 1–2** (their situation + our pricing)
   - "So you're at 6 locations, spending $7K/month today, acquiring 25 new patients/month"
   - "Our price for you would be $9K/month (Growth Tier)"
   - **Don't oversell. Just state facts.**

3. **Present Moderate Scenario first** (30% growth)
   - "Based on similar groups, you'd likely see 20–40% growth in new patients"
   - "Let's use 30% as our middle estimate"
   - **Show the math clearly**: 25 patients → 32.5 patients = 90 additional patients = $216K revenue
   - "That's a 6-month payback and $108K profit in Year 1"

4. **Offer Conservative & Aggressive as anchors**
   - Conservative: "Even if we only hit 15%, you break even and improve reporting"
   - Aggressive: "If we hit 50% (possible in competitive markets), you're looking at $252K profit"

5. **Show Year 2–3 cumulative** (to illustrate compounding)
   - "But the real value is compound. By Year 3, you've made $648K on a $108K annual investment"

6. **Address the "cost" objection**
   - "Yes, this is $24K MORE per year than you're spending now"
   - "But that's because we're including services (Paid Search, Social, Reputation) that your fragmented team wasn't doing"
   - "Net effect: Better ROI, not higher cost"

7. **Offer a 90-day guarantee** (optional, but powerful)
   - "We're so confident in these numbers that we offer a 90-day optimization period"
   - "If you're not seeing progress by Month 3, we adjust strategy at no additional cost"

## SECTION 10: COMMON OBJECTIONS & CALCULATOR RESPONSES

### Objection: "This assumes 30% growth, but I don't think we can grow that much."

**Response:**
"That's fair. Let's look at the 15% conservative scenario instead. At 15%, you break even in Year 1 and then profit in Year 2+. Even if we hit the conservative case, you also get unified reporting, 60% less internal management time, and brand consistency—all worth something. And 30% is what we see from most clients with fragmented marketing like yours. We're confident we can deliver it."

---

### Objection: "We're already spending $84K/year. Why would I spend $108K?"

**Response:**
"Great question. The $24K difference isn't 'extra cost'—it's that you're getting services you either weren't getting or were fragmented:
- Paid search management (Google Ads)
- Social media management
- Reputation management at scale
- Unified reporting & strategy

Your current team is handling these piecemeal or not at all. So it's not that we're expensive—it's that your current setup was incomplete. And the $108K pays for itself 6-12 months through new patient growth."

---

### Objection: "What if we don't see 30% growth?"

**Response:**
"Two things: First, we guarantee our effort and expertise—not growth (because growth depends on your team's execution too). Second, we'll show you month-by-month what's working. If by Month 3 we're not on track, we adjust strategy at no cost. Third, even in a slow-growth scenario (15%), the unified reporting and internal time savings alone are worth $30K+ per year."

---

### Objection: "I'm not sure this math is realistic."

**Response:**
"Totally fair to be skeptical. These numbers come from our actual client results. But here's what I'd suggest: Let's do a free audit of your current marketing. I'll show you exactly where new patients are coming from today and where we think the opportunities are. Then you can decide if 20–40% growth is realistic for your group."
