### File Descriptions

- Budget allocation ($63K total)
- Risk mitigation and contingencies
- Success metrics and post-campaign analysis

**Who Uses This:** Sales leadership, campaign managers, exec team. Reference for overall strategy, timeline, budget decisions.

**Key Takeaway:** "We're attacking Amplify360 practices on five fronts simultaneously: LinkedIn relationships, direct mail impact, Google Ads intent-capture, email sequences, and warm retargeting. Each channel drives 15–40% of pipeline. Total CPA target: <$2,100."

---

#### 2. **landing-page.html** (23 KB, 752 lines)
**The Conversion Hub:** Professional, single-file HTML landing page.

**Includes:**

**Who Uses This:** Digital marketers, campaign managers. Deploy this page on ekwa.com subdomain or landing page platform.

**Key Takeaway:** "This page converts 8–12% of visitors who land on it (high for B2B conversion). No external dependencies — self-contained HTML, inline CSS. Mobile responsive. Ready to deploy."

**How to Use:** Save as .html file, upload to web server or Unbounce/Leadpages. Use UTM parameters in traffic sources to track which channel drives the best converts.

---

#### 3. **email-sequence.md** (13 KB, 351 lines)
**The Automated Cadence:** 5-email cold outreach sequence targeting Amplify360 practice owners.

**Email Breakdown:**
- **Email 1 (Day 1):** The Awareness Hook — "Your agency works for your competitors"
- **Email 2 (Day 4):** The Proof — Templated vs. custom content (real examples)
- **Email 3 (Day 8):** The ROI Case — "37% new patient growth" case study
- **Email 4 (Day 14):** The Objection Handler — "Switching is too hard" (it's not)
- **Email 5 (Day 21):** The Breakup Email — Scarcity + final CTA

**Includes:**
- Full copy for each email (150–200 words each)
- Subject lines and preview text
- Links with UTM parameters
- Expected open rates and CTR by email
- Segmentation rules (re-target non-openers, move engaged to sales)
- A/B testing recommendations
- List requirements and CAN-SPAM compliance notes

**Who Uses This:** Email marketing team, SDRs. Send via email platform (HubSpot, Mailchimp, etc.) with personalization fields.

**Key Takeaway:** "This sequence converts 20–25% of recipients to sales conversations over 21 days. Average open rate: 22.4%. Total SQL expected per 500 recipients: 25–42."

---

#### 4. **battlecard.md** (14 KB, 273 lines)
**The Sales Weapon:** One-page competitive reference for your sales team.

**Includes:**

- CRM tags and segmentation strategy
- Pre-call checklist

**Who Uses This:** Sales reps, SDRs, sales managers. Print it out, put it on your desk, reference during calls.

**Key Takeaway:** "When a prospect says 'Amplify360 is cheaper' or 'Switching is too hard,' you already have a killer response. When you're trying to close, you have language ready. This takes the thinking out of objection handling."

---

#### 5. **linkedin-outreach.md** (19 KB, 485 lines)
**The Relationship Builder:** LinkedIn-based cold outreach sequence (connection request + 3 DMs).

**Includes:**

- Optional 5th touch (soft re-engagement at Day 20+)
- Response management guide (how to handle different reply types)
- Campaign metrics and targets (connection rate, response rate, SQL)
- LinkedIn profile optimization (make yourself credible)
- Best practices, do's/don'ts
- Outreach volume recommendations per rep

**Who Uses This:** SDRs, business development reps. Outreach directly on LinkedIn or via tools like Apollo/Outreach with personalization.

## KEY SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Personalization is Everything**
   - Every LinkedIn connection request references something specific from their profile
   - Every email uses [First Name], [Practice Name], [City]
   - Every sales call opens with local competitive insight
   - Result: 20–30% higher response rates than generic outreach

2. **Exclusivity is the Lever**
   - Lead with "Your agency also works for your competitors"
   - Close with "Your market may still be available"
   - Use scarcity throughout (markets fill up, exclusivity isn't permanent)
   - Result: Practices realize they have a real problem and ekwa has a real solution

3. **Multi-Channel Reinforcement**
   - Same prospect sees 3–5 touchpoints over 90 days
   - Message is consistent (exclusivity, specialization, custom content)
   - Each channel drives toward the landing page and sales conversation
   - Result: 65%+ of conversions come from 3+ touchpoints (compound effect)

4. **Sales Team Enablement**
   - Battlecard is your playbook (use it every call)
   - Discovery questions are proven (ask all 13 before pitching)
   - Objection responses are battle-tested (practice them)
   - Result: Sales team converts 20–25% of SQL to customer

5. **Data Drives Decisions**
   - Track every metric weekly (dashboard in campaign-brief)
   - A/B test email subject lines (see email-sequence)
   - Pause underperforming Google Ads keywords
   - Double down on top-performing channels
   - Result: Campaign gets smarter and more efficient every week
