## TOP 5 OBJECTIONS & KILLER RESPONSES

### Objection 1: "Amplify360 is cheaper. We can't justify the extra cost."

**Your Killer Response:**
"You're right, they're cheaper. And you know why? Because they're cheaper to everyone — 800 practices pay them, and they treat all of you the same. Here's the real math: If Amplify360 brings you 2 new patients/month at $1,500, that's $750/patient. If ekwa brings you 3 new patients/month because we're not distracted by your competitors, that's $833/patient. But you also get one thing priceless: an agency that isn't working *against* you.

**What would 25% better results be worth?** Not $1,000 more per month, I promise."

**Killer Stat to Cite:** One of our orthodontics practices saw 37% new patient growth by switching from a non-exclusive agency. That growth paid for the premium pricing in 3 months.

---

### Objection 2: "But Amplify360 says they give us dedicated account support."

**Your Killer Response:**
"They might. And they probably do. But here's the conflict: that account manager's day is split between you and 7–10 other practices. When you need strategy, they're updating content for someone else. When you need fast response, they're in a meeting for another practice.

At ekwa, your account expert's entire week is built around your goals. There's no context-switching. No "let me check with my other clients." Just focus on *your* growth."

**Killer Question to Ask:** "How quickly does your Amplify360 rep typically respond to your questions? A few hours? A day?"

---

### Objection 3: "Switching agencies is too much work. We don't want the headache."

**Your Killer Response:**
"That's totally fair. Here's the thing though: we handle the lift. Week 1, we audit everything. Week 2, we strategize. Week 3, we migrate all your accounts, analytics, historical data. Week 4, we go live. You sit back and watch it work.

We've done this 400 times. We know the painful parts — and we eliminate them. By week 2, you'll forget why you were ever worried."

**Process to Walk Them Through:**
- Week 1: Full audit + transition planning
- Week 2: Custom strategy + asset migration prep
- Week 3: Account migrations + setup
- Week 4: Go live + optimize

**Killer Stat:** Average transition takes 3–4 weeks. No loss of momentum. No missed campaigns.

---

### Objection 4: "Amplify360 is already running our Google Ads and they're working okay."

**Your Killer Response:**
"Okay is the enemy of great. And here's what I'm hearing: they're not *bad*, they're just... fine. Treating you like one of 800.

What if I told you we could improve those same Google Ads by 20–30% just by making them dental-specific and market-specific? Same budget, smarter strategy.

Here's a question: Does Amplify360 ever *proactively* suggest optimizations? Or do you have to ask?"

**What You're Actually Saying:** Your competitors are getting the same "okay" results. Difference is, ekwa makes sure *your* competitors aren't your agency's other clients.

---

### Objection 5: "We've been with Amplify360 for 3 years. We don't want to start over."

**Your Killer Response:**
"That's actually the best time to evaluate. You've seen what 3 years with them looks like. Question: are you where you want to be? Are they pushing you to grow? Or are you just... steady?

Here's what switching actually means: you're not starting over. You're starting over with 3 years of data about what works in your market. And you're bringing that learnings to an agency that specializes in dentistry and won't distract you by working for your competitors.

Some of our best clients were with non-exclusive agencies for years. They told us the same thing: 'Why didn't we do this sooner?'"

**Killer Close:** "Why don't we do a quick audit? No commitment, just 20 minutes. I want to show you what's possible with exclusivity focused on your practice."

## DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (Ask Before Pitching)

### Discovery Set A: Current Pain
1. How long have you been with your current marketing agency?
2. What's your biggest frustration with them right now?
3. How responsive are they when you need something?
4. Do you feel like a priority to them, or one of many?
5. Have you ever noticed your agency working with competitors in your city?

### Discovery Set B: Marketing Reality
6. What are your current marketing channels? (Google Ads, SEO, Social, etc.)
7. What's your monthly marketing budget?
8. What's your target new patient acquisition rate?
9. How many new patients are you getting per month right now?
10. What does success look like for you in the next 12 months?

### Discovery Set C: Competitive Insight
11. Do you know if Amplify360 works with any of your direct competitors?
12. Have you compared Amplify360 pricing vs. other agencies?
13. What would it take for you to consider a change?

### The Killer Discovery Question
**"If I could show you an agency that guarantees they won't work for your competitors, specializes in dentistry, and can improve your results by 25%, would that be worth a conversation?"**

(Almost everyone says yes. Then you've qualified them.)

## RED FLAGS: When Prospect is Probably a Bad Fit

- ❌ No current marketing strategy (too much education needed)
- ❌ Budget under $2,000/month (need minimum spend for ROI)
- ❌ Recently signed 2-year contract with competitor (switching costs too high)
- ❌ Owner not directly involved in decision (no champion)
- ❌ "We just want to reduce cost" mindset (value not understood)
- ❌ Not interested in exclusivity (wrong motivation)

**When you see these:** Offer to re-engage in 12–18 months. Don't force a bad fit.

## CLOSING LANGUAGE PLAYBOOK

### The Scarcity Close
"Your market is still open under our exclusivity guarantee. But once we bring on another [Specialty] practice in [City], that's it. Your exclusive advantage is gone. When do you want to talk about reserving it?"

### The Confidence Close
"Here's what I know: if you stay with a non-exclusive agency, your competitors know it too. They're seeing your campaigns because the same agency runs theirs. Not ideal. Let's change that."

### The Future Close
"Imagine 12 months from now. You've switched to ekwa. Your marketing is custom, not templated. Your agency works only for you. Your new patient flow is up 25%. Was that worth the 3-week transition? I think so."

### The Honesty Close
"I'm not here to trash-talk Amplify360. They're fine. But fine isn't growth. And growth is what you hired marketing to do. Let's talk about what's possible with an agency that's actually focused on *you*."

---

## POSITIONING SUMMARY (The Elevator Pitch)

**"We're ekwa. We do dental marketing differently than Amplify360. They serve 800 practices with no exclusivity. We serve 400 practices with a guarantee: we won't work for your competitors. That changes everything. Your agency stops competing for attention with your competitors' budgets. Your strategy becomes truly custom, not templated. And your success actually becomes our success. Want to see the difference 16 years of dental-only specialization looks like?"**

---

## RED PHRASES TO AVOID

- ❌ "We're better than Amplify360" (defensive, sounds salesy)
- ❌ "They don't know dentistry like we do" (arrogant)
- ❌ "You're wasting money with them" (aggressive)
- ❌ "This is a no-brainer" (dismissive of their concerns)
- ❌ "Everyone's switching from Amplify360" (false claim)

### GREEN PHRASES TO USE INSTEAD

- ✓ "Here's how exclusivity changes the math..."
- ✓ "The reason 400+ practices have stuck with us for 10+ years..."
- ✓ "If your agency is serving your competitors, here's what that actually costs..."
- ✓ "Let me show you what true dental specialization looks like..."
- ✓ "Your market may still be available for exclusive representation..."

## QUICK REFERENCE: TALKING POINTS BY SCENARIO

### Scenario 1: "We Just Signed a 1-Year Extension with Amplify360"
**Your Move:** Congratulations! One question: are you locked in contractually, or could you move if something better came along?

*Why:* Some "agreements" are loose. You never know until you ask.

### Scenario 2: "We Love Amplify360, but We're Frustrated with [Specific Thing]"
**Your Move:** That's super common. [Specific Thing] is actually solvable with a specialist agency. Mind if I show you how?

*Why:* This is your in. They've identified a problem. You're not bashing their current agency; you're solving a pain point.

### Scenario 3: "We're Happy with Them"
**Your Move:** That's great. Quick question: would you say you're growing, or maintaining?

*Why:* "Happy" often means "not unhappy." There's a difference between happy and growing.

### Scenario 4: "How Are You Different from Amplify360?"
**Your Move:** Great question. We're different in three ways: we don't work for your competitors (exclusivity), we specialize in dentistry only (16 years), and we write custom content instead of templates. Those three things compound.

*Why:* Direct, specific, memorable.

- ✓ Understood their current situation (how long, what they do, frustrations)
- ✓ Identified their primary pain (competitor conflict? Results? Support?)
- ✓ Presented the exclusivity advantage (make it real, not theoretical)
- ✓ Addressed their top objection (don't leave it hanging)
- ✓ Shown proof of concept (case study, stat, or specific example)
- ✓ Asked for next step (demo, audit, call with founder, etc.)
- ✓ Set a follow-up date (if they're not ready now)
- ✓ Confirmed they understand exclusivity is limited (scarcity message)

---

## FINAL MINDSET

You're not selling against Amplify360. You're selling **exclusivity** and **specialization**. That's not aggressive. That's clarity.

Amplify360 gives practices a commodity service. They give everyone the same thing.

You give exclusivity + specialization. That's different. That's better. That's worth more.

Own that difference.
