## EMAIL 1: THE AWARENESS HOOK
**Send:** Day 1
**Subject Line:** Did you know your marketing agency is also working for Dr. [Competitor Name]?
**Preview Text:** The uncomfortable truth about non-exclusive agencies…

### FULL EMAIL BODY

Hi [Practice Owner First Name],

Here's an uncomfortable question: **Is your marketing agency also marketing for your competitors?**

If you're with Amplify360, the answer is likely yes.

Amplify360 serves 800+ dental practices with zero territorial restrictions. That means they're actively running Google Ads, managing social media, and creating content for practices competing directly against yours — in the same city.

When your agency works for your competitors, your marketing budget doesn't have your back. It has everyone's back equally.

We're different. At ekwa, we represent ONE practice per specialty per market. Your success is our reputation. Your competitors' success is literally not our business.

Curious what that difference looks like?

P.S. We've been doing this since 2008. 400+ dental practices trust us precisely because we don't work for their competitors.

## EMAIL 2: THE PROOF
**Send:** Day 4
**Subject Line:** How dental-specific beats templated (real example)
**Preview Text:** Side-by-side: Custom content vs. templated. You'll see the difference immediately.

---

### FULL EMAIL BODY

Hi [Practice Owner First Name],

After Day 1, some of you clicked. Good. We hope the comparison made sense.

Here's what separates ekwa from Amplify360: **specificity.**

Amplify360 uses templates. One blog post about "Root Canals 101" gets repackaged for 50 practices. One social media calendar. One ad funnel. Same message, different zip codes.

ekwa writes for *your* practice. Your specialty. Your patient challenges. Your market.

**Example:**
- **Templated:** "Root canals are easier than you think." [Generic stock image]
- **Custom (ekwa):** "Why Dr. Mitchell specializes in complex root canals — and why that matters to your smile." [Your practice, your story, your patients]

One converts patients. One doesn't.

Dental marketing works because it's *specific*. And specificity takes time, expertise, and focus — which non-exclusive agencies don't have.

## EMAIL 3: THE ROI CASE
**Send:** Day 8
**Subject Line:** 37% more new patients. Here's how we did it.
**Preview Text:** Real ROI from a real dental practice. Numbers you can use.

---

### FULL EMAIL BODY

Hi [Practice Owner First Name],

You've probably noticed we're not just talking about *why* exclusivity matters. We're putting money where our mouth is.

Last year, one of our practices went from 12 new patients/month to 16–18. That's 37% growth in acquisition. Same budget. Same city. Different approach.

How?

1. **Exclusivity** = No competing for attention with other practices in your market
2. **Specialization** = Content actually speaks to your ideal patient
3. **Consistency** = One agency, one strategy, full alignment

Their secret wasn't magic. It was focus.

When your marketing agency doesn't work for your competitors, something shifts. Your wins are celebrated. Your challenges are solved. Your growth is their growth.

That's the ekwa difference.

Ready to see what 37% growth could mean for your practice?

## EMAIL 4: THE OBJECTION HANDLER
**Send:** Day 14
**Subject Line:** "Switching agencies is too much work." (It's not.)
**Preview Text:** We handle the lift. You get the benefit. Here's how.

---

### FULL EMAIL BODY

Hi [Practice Owner First Name],

By now, some of you are thinking: *"This sounds good, but switching agencies is a nightmare."*

Fair point. But here's what you probably don't know: **we handle 95% of the lift.**

**Here's how the transition works:**

- **Week 1:** We audit your current marketing. Content, ads, analytics, everything.
- **Week 2:** We build your custom strategy and timeline.
- **Week 3:** We migrate your assets, accounts, and analytics data.
- **Week 4:** We launch your new campaigns and pause the old ones.

You don't have to fire anyone or feel guilty. We manage the whole thing. You just show up and watch your new marketing work.

**And here's the real secret:** Most practices are so relieved to have an agency that actually prioritizes them that the "switching pain" disappears in 2–3 weeks.

No contracts. No lock-in. Just results.

## EMAIL 5: THE BREAKUP EMAIL (FINAL CTA + SCARCITY)
**Send:** Day 21
**Subject Line:** One more thing before we move on...
**Preview Text:** Your market is still available. But probably not for long.

---

### FULL EMAIL BODY

Hi [Practice Owner First Name],

We've thrown a lot at you over the last three weeks. Let's be direct.

**Your market is still available for exclusive representation with ekwa.**

But markets fill up fast. When we commit to ONE practice per specialty per city, we mean it. The moment we bring on another [Specialty] practice in [City], that's it. The exclusivity advantage goes away.

This isn't a sales tactic. It's just how we work.

**Three options:**

1. **Let's talk.** Schedule a 15-minute call. No pressure. No fluff. Just a real conversation about your growth.
2. **You're good.** Keep working with your current agency. We'll reach back out in 12 months.
3. **Maybe later.** Totally fine. But know that if another practice in your specialty grabs that exclusive slot, we can't offer it to you.

If you've made it this far in these emails, you probably already know the answer.

[BUTTON: Let's Reserve Your Market →]

No pressure. Just honesty.

Best,
[Sales Rep Name]

P.S. Our founder Naren started ekwa in 2008 specifically because he was frustrated with non-exclusive agencies too. 16 years later, we're still solving that same problem for practices like yours.

- **Nurture:** Non-clickers who opened 2+ emails — move to longer nurture cadence after sequence

### A/B Testing Recommendations

**Test 1: Subject Line Variation (Email 1)**
- Variant A: "Did you know your marketing agency is also working for Dr. [Competitor Name]?"
- Variant B: "The uncomfortable question about Amplify360..."
- Split: 50/50, send to small batch first

**Test 2: CTA Button Variations (All Emails)**
- Variant A: [See the Comparison →]
