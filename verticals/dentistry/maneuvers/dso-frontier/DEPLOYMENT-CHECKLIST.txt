================================================================================
CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
================================================================================

1. POSITIONING CLARITY
   The "Goldilocks" positioning must be consistent:
   - NOT trying to compete with enterprise platforms ($10K+/month)
   - NOT trying to compete with single-practice agencies
   - POSITIONING: The sweet spot for 3-15 location groups
   - MESSAGING: "Enterprise intelligence, boutique execution"

2. EXCLUSIVITY COMMITMENT
   This is your key differentiator. Must commit to:
   - One DSO group per geographic region/market
   - No conflicts of interest
   - Unified reporting across all their markets

3. TEAM DEDICATION
   This vertical needs a dedicated champion:
   - 1 FTE sales lead (outreach, closing, account management)
   - 0.5 FTE marketing lead (strategy, positioning, content)
   - 0.5 FTE support (reporting, proposals, calendar)

4. PARTNERSHIP VELOCITY
   Don't just sell direct. Partnerships are 20-30% of pipeline:
   - 1 person assigned to partnership development
   - Monthly targets: 2-3 new partnership agreements
   - Monthly targets: 2-5 partner referrals

5. CONTENT & CREDIBILITY
   Thought leadership builds trust:
   - Monthly LinkedIn articles on DSO marketing
   - Guest posts on Group Dentistry Now
   - Speaking opportunities at DSO conferences
   - Case studies (real, not hypothetical)

================================================================================
COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID
================================================================================

❌ POSITIONING CONFUSION
   Don't try to be everything to everyone
   Don't position as cheaper (you're not)
   DO position as "right-sized for DSOs"

❌ SLOW PARTNERSHIP EXECUTION
   Don't wait for perfect agreement
   Don't over-negotiate referral fees
   DO prioritize relationship > fee (trust first)

❌ COLD EMAIL FATIGUE
   Don't send 200+ emails simultaneously (spam flags)
   Don't use generic templates (personalize each)
   DO send 50/week, track opens, follow up systematically

❌ PROPOSAL BLOAT
   Don't send 20-page proposals (TL;DR)
   Don't leave pricing as a surprise (state upfront)
   DO keep proposals under 10 pages, pricing clear

❌ FORGETTING YOUR MOAT
   Don't compete on price (you'll lose)
   Don't oversell technology (you're human-centric)
   DO emphasize: Exclusivity + dental expertise + unified reporting

================================================================================
