# Operation DSO Frontier™ — Campaign Brief
## ekwa.com's Strategic Entry into the Small-to-Mid DSO Market

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ekwa is positioned to capture a $1.5M+ ARR opportunity by creating a dedicated DSO (Dental Support Organization) vertical targeting the 3–15 location segment. This market is **underserved**: enterprise platforms (PatientPop/Tebra) are too expensive and generic; single-practice agencies lack the scale and expertise. ekwa's 16-year dental specialization, human expert teams, and exclusivity model are **perfect moats** for this gap.

**Primary Goal**: Launch a DSO-focused offering within 90 days, establish market leadership, and secure 40+ DSO clients within 18 months.

---

## MARKET OPPORTUNITY & SIZING

### Current Market Context

- **Global DSO Market**: USD 163.93B (2024) → USD 835.87B (2034) at 17.65% CAGR
- **U.S. DSO Market**: USD 37.9B (2024) → USD 196.5B (2034) at 17.9% CAGR
- **North America dominates** at 34% global share due to advanced infrastructure, private equity backing, and consolidation trends
- **Key Driver**: Rapid consolidation of independent practices into multi-location groups, fueled by PE investment and operational complexity

### The Goldilocks Gap

| Segment | Size | Pricing Model | Pain Point |
|---------|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Enterprise DSO (50+ locations)** | $10M+ ARR | $10K–$25K/month per group | Cookie-cutter solutions; no personalization |
| **Single-Practice Agencies** | $1M–$3M ARR | $1K–$5K/month per practice | Can't manage multi-location complexity, brand consistency, unified reporting |
| **ekwa DSO Opportunity** | $1.5M+ potential | $800–$2,500/location/month | Boutique expertise + enterprise scale |

### Revenue Model Math

- **Conservative**: 20 DSO accounts × $24K/year average = $480K ARR
- **Target**: 40 DSO accounts × $30K/year average = $1.2M ARR
- **Aggressive**: 50 DSO accounts × $35K/year average = $1.75M ARR

**Per-location breakdown** (6-location group):
- Single-practice model: $4K–$6K/month total = $48K–$72K/year
- Multi-location pricing: $1,200–$1,800/location/month = $86.4K–$129.6K/year (still 30–50% cheaper than PatientPop)

## IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE (ICP)

### Primary ICP: Growth-Stage DSO Group

| Dimension | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| **Size** | 3–15 active dental locations |
| **Growth Stage** | Series A–Series B (PE-backed or founder-led) |
| **Revenue** | $3M–$15M annual practice revenue |
| **Geography** | Multi-state or multi-metro (4+ locations across different markets) |
| **Pain Level** | HIGH: managing inconsistent branding, multiple agencies, no unified reporting |
| **Budget** | $18K–$45K/year total marketing spend (already exists; seeking consolidation) |
| **Decision Maker** | VP of Marketing, COO, or Group CEO |

### Secondary ICP: Rolling-up Independent Groups

- Owner-operator consolidating 3–5 independent practices into an operating group
- First time managing multi-location marketing strategy
- Seeking unified brand positioning + local market presence

### Negative ICP (Avoid)

- Groups with <3 locations (too small, use single-practice offer)
- Groups with 16+ locations (likely enterprise maturity, need Tebra/PatientPop scale)
- Groups with in-house marketing director (low margin, doesn't match value prop)
- Franchisees of DSO platforms (brand locked-in)

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Current Solutions DSOs Are Using (Why They're Frustrated)

#### **Option 1: Enterprise Platforms (PatientPop/Tebra)**

| Attribute | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Pricing** | $10K–$25K/month ($120K–$300K/year) |
| **Strengths** | Dashboard, unified reporting, AI tools, compliance |
| **Weaknesses** | Generic templates; no local market expertise; impersonal support; overkill for 5–10 locations |
| **DSO Sentiment** | "We're overpaying for features we don't use" |

#### **Option 2: Multiple Single-Practice Agencies**

| Attribute | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Cost** | $4K–$6K/location/month = $24K–$60K/month for 6 locations |
| **Strengths** | Personalized local expertise; responsiveness |
| **Weaknesses** | **NO unified reporting**; brand inconsistency across sites; conflicts of interest (each agency optimizes for their location, not the group); logistics nightmare managing 5+ vendors |
| **DSO Sentiment** | "We have great local results but zero cohesion" |

#### **Option 3: Ad Networks (Google Ads, Facebook, Dental-Specific)**

| Attribute | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Cost** | Varies; $2K–$5K/location/month for management |
| **Strengths** | High controllability; transparent spend |
| **Weaknesses** | No SEO, no reputation management, no content; purely PPC/social; no strategic positioning |
| **DSO Sentiment** | "We're throwing money at ads but not building sustainable brand value" |

### ekwa's Competitive Advantage

1. **Exclusivity Model** (Nobody else in the market has this)
   - One agency per DSO group across ALL their markets
   - Eliminates conflicts of interest
   - Unified reporting, unified brand, unified strategy
   - PatientPop/Tebra offer no exclusivity guarantee; they work with 100+ practices in your market

2. **Dental-Only Expertise** (16+ years)
   - Single-practice experience translates to multi-location sophistication
   - Understand insurance, compliance, patient journey, hygiene scheduling impacts

3. **Local + Unified**
   - Each location gets local SEO, local GBP management, local content
   - Central command: unified reporting, unified brand guidelines, unified CAC tracking

4. **Human Experts, Not Software**
   - Dedicated team per DSO, not a black-box algorithm
   - Strategic relationship, not vendor relationship

5. **Pricing Sweet Spot**
   - $1,200–$1,800/location/month = 40–50% cheaper than enterprise platforms
   - Higher margin than single-practice work (leverage across locations)
