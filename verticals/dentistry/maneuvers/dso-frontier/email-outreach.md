# ekwa DSO Cold Outreach Sequence
## 3-Email Campaign for VP of Marketing / COO Decision Makers

---

## EMAIL 1: THE DISCOVERY
### Subject: "8 locations, 5 agencies—is this you?"
### Preview: "We think we spotted your biggest marketing bottleneck..."

---

**From:** [Name], ekwa
**To:** [VP of Marketing / COO at DSO Group]

Hi [First Name],

I was looking at your group's locations across [Region] and something struck me: your SEO is solid, but your **brand message is completely fragmented**.

Your Austin location is talking about cosmetic dentistry on their site. Your San Antonio office is emphasizing affordability. Dallas is all family-focused. Meanwhile, your main site sounds like something else entirely.

This usually happens when you've got 4–5 different agencies, each optimizing their piece without talking to the others.

**Here's the thing:** You're probably paying $30K–$50K/month across all those agencies. And you're **not getting unified reporting**—so you have no idea which location is actually driving new patients or how your brand consistency is affecting your growth.

We work with 3–15 location dental groups like yours, and the pattern is always the same:
- Great local results, terrible cohesion
- No single source of truth for new patient data
- Agency juggling = chaos for your marketing team

We take a different approach: **one agency, one strategy, all your markets.** No conflicts. Unified reporting. Dedicated team.

If you've been thinking about consolidating your marketing, let's chat. Might save you 40% of what you're spending and give you actual clarity on what's working.

## EMAIL 2: THE CASE STUDY
### Subject: "How a 6-location Texas group grew 34% (and halved their agencies)"
### Preview: "The consolidation story that's working for dental groups your size..."

---

**From:** [Name], ekwa
**To:** [VP of Marketing / COO at DSO Group]

Hi [First Name],

Quick follow-up to my last email. Didn't hear back, so I wanted to share something that might be relevant.

We just wrapped up Year 1 with a 6-location dental group in Texas (similar to your group's size). When they came to us, they were managing **3 separate agencies, $7K/month in overlapping spend, and zero unified reporting.**

Here's what happened after we consolidated their marketing:

**The Problem:**
- 3 agencies, 3 different narratives
- Each location reporting independently (a nightmare for their COO)
- No way to track which location drove the highest-value new patients
- Marketing budget constantly questioned because "we don't see the full picture"

**The Approach:**
- Unified brand positioning across all 6 locations (same voice, localized for each market)
- One dashboard showing all 6 locations' performance
- Consolidated SEO strategy (no more conflicting keyword priorities)
- Single monthly strategy call instead of quarterly calls with multiple vendors

**The Results (12 months):**
- 34% growth in organic new patients
- Reduced total monthly spend from $7K to $4.5K (consolidation discount)
- Marketing team time cut by ~60% (one vendor relationship instead of three)
- CEO finally has visibility into marketing ROI

The best part? They went from feeling like marketing was a cost center to realizing they had a **scalable growth engine**. They're planning to open 2 more locations next year, and they already know how the playbook extends.

If this sounds like something your group might benefit from, I'd love to show you a few quick examples from their playbook and help you calculate your potential savings.

## EMAIL 3: THE OFFER
### Subject: "Let's do a free audit of your 8 locations"
### Preview: "One hour. We'll show you exactly where you're losing money..."

---

**From:** [Name], ekwa
**To:** [VP of Marketing / COO at DSO Group]

Hi [First Name],

Last email, I promise. :)

I got the sense from my previous emails that you might be at a point where consolidating your marketing is on the radar—even if it's not the top priority this quarter.

So here's what I'd like to offer:

**Free Multi-Location Marketing Audit**

We'll spend an hour reviewing:
1. **Brand Consistency Audit:** How are your locations talking differently to the market? (Usually there are 3–5 gaps we can fix immediately)
2. **Local SEO Snapshot:** Which locations are ranking well? Which are missing obvious opportunities?
3. **Marketing Spend Efficiency:** Based on what you're paying now, where's the waste? Where's the opportunity?
4. **Consolidation ROI Calc:** If you moved to one agency (us), what would you actually save? What would you gain?

We'll deliver it in a simple 1-page report you can share with your team. No hard sell. Just data.

The goal is simple: **help you see what you're not seeing right now.**

Want to schedule it? Calendly link below:

If that doesn't work, we can do a quick 20-minute discovery call first—I can answer any questions before we dive into the full audit.

Either way, happy to help.

P.S. — If you're not the right person for this, would you mind pointing me toward whoever owns marketing or operations at your group? (Often it's a VP of Ops or Group CEO for DSOs.) Would appreciate the intro.

## CAMPAIGN STRATEGY NOTES

### Audience Targeting

**Primary:**
- VP of Marketing (if the group is large enough to have one)
- Chief Operating Officer (COO)
- Group President / CEO

**Secondary:**
- Director of Operations
- Director of Patient Growth

Find these contacts via:
- LinkedIn Sales Navigator (search by company size, title, geography)
- ZoomInfo (filter by DSO size, role)
- Company websites (leadership pages)
- ADSO membership directory (if DSO is ADSO member)

### Send Timing

- **Email 1:** Day 1
- **Email 2:** Day 5–7 (if no reply)
- **Email 3:** Day 14–16 (if no reply)
- **Follow-up:** After Email 3, don't re-contact for 30 days

### A/B Testing Variants

**Subject Line Variants (test Email 1):**
- "8 locations, 5 agencies—is this you?"
- "Why your group's marketing feels fragmented (and what to do about it)"
- "Quick question: how many marketing agencies does your group use?"
- "Your competitors are consolidating their marketing. Are you?"

**Value Props to Test:**
- Consolidation / simplification angle (for pain-driven buyers)
- Unified reporting / visibility angle (for data-driven buyers)
- Cost savings angle (for budget-conscious COOs)
- Growth angle (for CEO/Presidents)

### Expected Response Rates

Based on dental industry benchmarks:
- **Open rate:** 25–30%
- **Reply rate:** 5–12%
- **Proposal request rate:** 2–5% of opens
- **Close rate:** 40–60% of proposals

For 100 cold emails:
- ~27 opens
- ~7 replies
- ~1.5 strategy call requests
- ~0.6–1.0 closes (depending on proposal strength)

### Follow-Up Tactics (If No Email Response)

- **LinkedIn connection + DM:** "I've reached out via email a couple times—would love to connect here and continue the conversation"
- **Phone call:** If you have a number, a brief voicemail: "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from ekwa. I've been trying to reach you about a marketing opportunity for your dental group. Give me a call back at [Number] or let me know the best time to connect."
- **Re-engage after 30 days:** If no response after three emails, pause for a month. Then send one more email with fresher hook: "Quick update: We just onboarded another group in [nearby state]. Thought you'd want to see the before/after..."

### Message Customization Tips

For maximum effectiveness, customize each email with:
- **Specific location names** (shows you did homework)
- **Real recent changes** (if you know they opened a location or hired a CMO, mention it)
- **Regional context** (if they're in a competitive market, call it out)
- **Company size confirmation** (make sure your ICP assumptions are right)

Example opener improvement:
- **Generic:** "I was looking at your group..."
- **Personalized:** "I was looking at your Austin and San Antonio locations and noticed you refreshed your website in Q3, but your local SEO strategy hasn't caught up yet..."

## ADDITIONAL CUSTOMIZATION FOR SPECIFIC SEGMENTS

### Variant A: PE-Backed DSO Groups

**Key angle:** Operational efficiency + margin expansion

*Opener tweak:*
"We work with a lot of [Apex/Dental / KKR-backed] groups, and we usually see the same gap: marketing is fragmented, which means margin is leaking. One client we just onboarded was losing 20% of revenue potential just from brand inconsistency across locations..."

### Variant B: Founder-Led / Owner-Operator Groups

**Key angle:** Peace of mind + less chaos

*Opener tweak:*
"Managing multiple locations means juggling multiple agencies, vendors, reporting systems... it's chaos. We take all of that off your plate and give you one trusted partner who owns your entire marketing strategy across all your markets."

### Variant C: Groups That Recently Opened New Locations

**Key angle:** Scaling challenge + unified growth

*Opener tweak:*
"Noticed you just opened your [6th/7th] location in [Market]. Congratulations! Most groups we work with realize around this point that managing marketing across multiple agencies gets exponentially harder. Curious how you're handling the marketing side of the expansion..."
