## PARTNERSHIP KICKOFF EMAIL TEMPLATE

Subject: Partnership Opportunity – ekwa + [Firm Name]

Hi [Name],

I came across your firm while researching best-in-class partners for our new DSO marketing vertical, and I think there's a natural partnership opportunity.

**What we do:** We consolidate marketing for 3–15 location dental groups (DSOs), replacing fragmented agencies with one unified strategy. Most of our clients are groups your firm likely works with or advises.

**What we're proposing:**
- **Referral agreement**: $2,500–$5,000 per DSO client we successfully close from your referrals
- **Co-marketing**: We'll collaborate on case studies, webinars, or joint messaging if helpful
- **Mutual value**: You gain a trusted marketing partner to recommend; we gain access to your DSO client relationships

**Next step:** Would you be open to a brief call (15 min) where I can show you a case study or two and we can explore whether this makes sense?

[Calendar link]

Looking forward to building something great together.

[Your name]
ekwa
