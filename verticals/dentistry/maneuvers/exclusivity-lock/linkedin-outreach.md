- Active on LinkedIn (likely to respond)

**Timeline:**
- Connection Request: Day 0

- Message 2 (Value): Day 6–7
- Message 3 (CTA): Day 10–11

---

## STEP 1: CONNECTION REQUEST

**Send immediately after finding prospect profile**

### Copy (Keep It Simple)

Hi [First Name],

I follow your practice on LinkedIn and love the work you're doing with [specific thing you noticed on their profile/page — e.g., "your recent team expansion"].

I help dental practices grow through exclusive marketing strategies. Thought it might be worth a conversation.

Looking forward to connecting.

Best,
[Your Name]
ekwa Dental Marketing

### Connection Request Tips

- **Personalization is Critical.** Reference something specific from their profile or practice page. Generic requests get ignored.
- **Length:** 2–3 sentences max. Connection requests should be brief.
- **Tone:** Friendly, not salesy. You're introducing yourself, not pitching.
- **Emoji:** Optional. If you use one, ONE emoji max (e.g., 🎯). Keep it professional.
- **Timing:** Send Mon–Thu, 9–10 AM EST. Avoid Fridays (people check LinkedIn less).
- **Success Rate:** Target 40–50% connection acceptance rate.

### Personalization Examples

**For Practice Owners:**
"Hi [First Name], saw your practice just expanded to a second location in [City]. That's impressive. I specialize in helping practices scale through targeted marketing..."

**For Office Managers:**
"Hi [First Name], I noticed [Practice Name] is actively hiring. Growing practices like yours are exactly who I work with. Would love to chat..."

**For Corporate/DSO Leaders:**
"Hi [First Name], I follow [DSO Name] and see the growth you're having across your markets. We work exclusively with practices in your portfolio..."

---

## STEP 2: FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE 1 (Day 2–3)
**Subject: Gratitude + Social Proof**

### Copy (140–160 words)

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for accepting the connection request!

I wanted to reach out because I noticed you're at [Practice Name], and I work with practices like yours in [City/Market] to grow new patient acquisition through exclusive, specialty-focused marketing.

The reason I'm reaching out specifically is that one of the biggest challenges we see with dental practices is working with marketing agencies that also work for your competitors. It splits focus, dilutes strategy, and (honestly) makes the whole thing less effective.

At ekwa, we're different — we represent only ONE practice per specialty per market. That means when we work with you, we're not working for [Competitor Practice Name] down the street.

Curious if you've thought about what it would mean to have a marketing agency completely focused on your practice?

Happy to share some thoughts.

[Your Name]

### Message 1 Strategy Notes

**What You're Doing:**
- Establishing credibility (you know their market)
- Identifying a specific pain (non-exclusive agencies)
- Presenting a unique solution (exclusivity)
- Inviting conversation (not pushing)

**Why It Works:**
- Acknowledges their industry (not generic)
- References a real problem they face
- Shows you understand their market
- Opens dialogue, doesn't close

**Expected Response Rate:** 8–15% (some will engage, some will ignore)

---

## STEP 3: FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE 2 (Day 6–7)
**Subject: Value / Case Study / Industry Insight**

### Copy (150–180 words)

Hi [First Name],

Not sure if my last message landed, but I wanted to share something quick.

We just worked with an orthodontics practice in [similar city/market] who was with a non-exclusive agency. They came to us frustrated because their marketing didn't feel *specific* to their practice — it felt templated.

Here's what changed when they switched to ekwa:

1. **Exclusivity**: We don't work for your competitors. Focus isn't split.
2. **Specialization**: Content is written for *ortho* patients specifically, not generic dental.
3. **Partnership**: You become our priority, not 1 of 800 clients.

Result: They went from 12 to 18 new patients per month in 6 months. Same budget. Different approach.

Thought you might relate to some of that. Happy to share more specifics, or no pressure if your current situation is working great.

Either way, glad to be connected!

[Your Name]

### Message 2 Strategy Notes

**What You're Doing:**
- Providing social proof (real case study)
- Showing specific results (numbers)
- Reinforcing the exclusivity angle
- Giving them an out ("no pressure")

**Why It Works:**
- Case studies resonate (proves you deliver)
- Specific numbers are credible
- "No pressure" removes sales-iness
- Reinforces your unique angle

**Expected Response Rate:** 5–12% (some will respond with interest, most will still ignore but are warming)

---

## STEP 4: FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE 3 (Day 10–11)
**Subject: Direct CTA / Scarcity / Last Attempt**

### Copy (120–150 words)

Hi [First Name],

Last quick thought, then I'll let you breathe.

I notice [Practice Name] isn't working with ekwa yet, which means your market is still available for exclusive representation. But honestly, that window doesn't stay open forever — the moment we sign another [Specialty] practice in [City], we can't offer exclusivity to anyone else.

If you've thought about what it might mean to work with an agency that doesn't work for your competitors, I'd love to show you how the transition works (it's easy, we handle 95% of it).

If now's not the time, totally get it. Just don't want you to find out later that your market filled up.

[BUTTON: Let's chat briefly →]

Talk soon,
[Your Name]

---

### Message 3 Strategy Notes

**What You're Doing:**
- Creating scarcity (market fills up)
- Making a direct ask (let's chat)
- Addressing friction (easy transition)
- Giving explicit out ("if now's not the time")

**Why It Works:**
- Scarcity motivates action
- Direct CTA is clear
- Overcoming objections (switching pain)
- Respects their time

**Expected Response Rate:** 8–18% (this is the final push — some will engage, some will ignore)

---

## OPTIONAL: STEP 5 (Day 20+)
**If No Response After Message 3: Soft Re-engagement (2–3 Weeks Later)**

### Copy (80–100 words)

Hi [First Name],

Totally understand if marketing agency conversations aren't top of mind right now.

Just wanted to say — if you ever want to talk about what exclusivity in dental marketing actually looks like, I'm here.

No hard feelings either way. Cheers to the growth of [Practice Name]!

## ENGAGEMENT TRACKING & RESPONSE MANAGEMENT

### Response Types & How to Handle Them

#### Response Type A: "Interested — Tell Me More"
*Example: "This sounds interesting. What does the transition look like?"*

**Your Action:**
- Respond within 2 hours
- Schedule a 20-minute call (not a full demo yet)
- Agenda: Learn about their situation, share how you work, answer questions
- Use Calendly link for easy scheduling

**Sample Response:**
"Love it! Let's chat. Here's my calendar: [Calendly link]. I'm thinking 20 minutes to understand your situation and how ekwa works. Sound good?"

---

#### Response Type B: "We're Happy with Our Current Agency"
*Example: "Thanks but we're happy with Amplify360."*

**Your Action:**
- Don't push. Acknowledge and pivot.
- Plant a seed for future re-engagement.

**Sample Response:**
"Totally get it. No pressure at all. Just know if you ever want to explore what exclusivity looks like, I'm a message away. Rooting for your practice's growth!"

---

#### Response Type C: "Tell Me More About Your Pricing"
*Example: "Interested, but what's your pricing?"*

**Your Action:**
- Don't send pricing via LinkedIn DM (too formal, can't explain value)
- Move to a call or calendar link

**Sample Response:**
"Great question. Pricing depends on your specific situation, which is why I'd love a quick call to understand what you're looking for. Does Thursday work? [Calendly]"

---

#### Response Type D: "How Are You Different from Amplify360?"
*Example: "Sounds cool, but how is ekwa different from what we have?"*

**Your Action:**
- This is a QUALIFIED response. They're interested enough to ask.
- Provide 3 core differences (exclusivity, specialization, custom content)
- Suggest a call to go deeper

**Sample Response:**
"Love the question. Three things: 1) We don't work for your competitors (exclusivity), 2) We specialize in dentistry only (not healthcare generalist), 3) We write custom content, not templates. That combination changes everything. Want to talk through how it applies to your practice? [Calendly]"

## PERSONALIZATION DATABASE

Before you send any message, populate these fields:

```
[First Name] = Extract from LinkedIn profile
[Practice Name] = Company name on their profile
[Specialty] = From company description (General, Ortho, Perio, Oral Surgery, etc.)
[City/Market] = Location of practice
[Competitor Practice Name] = Research local competitors in same specialty
[Similar City/Market] = Find a comparable market to your case study
[Your Name] = Your first and last name
[Calendly Link] = Your scheduling link
```

### Personalization Levels

**Level 1 (Minimum):** [First Name], [Practice Name]
**Level 2 (Better):** Level 1 + [Specialty], [City/Market]
**Level 3 (Best):** Level 2 + Reference to something specific from their profile/page + [Competitor Name]

---

## LINKEDIN PROFILE OPTIMIZATION (Your End)

Before you start outreach, make sure YOUR LinkedIn profile is rock-solid:

**Profile Must Have:**
- ✓ Professional headshot (clear, friendly, dental industry context if possible)
- ✓ Headline: "Dental Marketing Specialist | ekwa" or similar
- ✓ About section: 2–3 paragraphs about your expertise in dental marketing, not generic sales pitch
- ✓ Recent activity: Like/comment on dental content, ekwa company posts, industry content
- ✓ Endorsements: Get endorsements for "Dental Marketing," "Exclusive Marketing," "B2B Sales"
- ✓ Recommendations: At least 2–3 recommendations from clients or colleagues
- ✓ Post cadence: 1–2 posts/month on dental marketing topics (builds credibility)

**Why This Matters:**
When they click your profile after seeing your connection request, they judge whether you're credible. A strong profile = higher acceptance rate, higher response rate.

---

## BEST PRACTICES & DO'S/DON'Ts

### DO
- ✓ Personalize EVERY message (reference something real from their profile)
- ✓ Keep messages 2–3 sentences in connection request, 3–5 paragraphs in DMs
- ✓ Space messages 3–4 days apart (don't spam)
- ✓ Respond within 2 hours to any interested prospects
- ✓ Move interested prospects to a call ASAP (LinkedIn is just intro)
- ✓ Reference ekwa's founding story (16 years, dental-only expertise)
- ✓ Use Calendly/scheduling link for easy booking
- ✓ Track open rates and response rates (LinkedIn shows read receipts)

### DON'T
- ✗ Send generic connection requests ("I'd like to add you to my network")
- ✗ Pitch immediately in Message 1 (build relationship first)
- ✗ Send messages longer than necessary (most people skim LinkedIn)
- ✗ Use excessive LinkedIn automation (too robotic, flags as spam)
- ✗ Mention pricing in DMs (move to call first)
- ✗ Argue if they push back (stay positive, move on)
- ✗ Send to unverified profiles (research first)
- ✗ Ignore people who respond (always reply, even if it's a "no")

---

## OUTREACH VOLUME RECOMMENDATIONS

**Per Rep, Per Month:**
- Connection requests sent: 150–200

## SUCCESS STORY TEMPLATE (For Messages)

Example in action:
"We worked with an orthodontics practice in Austin who was with a non-exclusive agency. They were frustrated because their marketing felt generic, not ortho-specific.
