Hi {{contact.firstname}},

Thanks again for taking the time to chat this morning. I really appreciated learning more about {{contact.company}} and where you're focused with cosmetic vs. medical dermatology patient acquisition.

One thing that stuck with me: you mentioned that your current marketing partner hasn't really nailed positioning for both segments. That's a gap we see a lot, and it's exactly what dermatology-specialized strategy is built to solve.

I'm going to send over a brief case study of another derm practice in your region — similar size, similar service mix. You'll see the results we drove in the first 90 days.

Happy to hop on a call this week if you want to walk through specifics for {{contact.company}}.

Hi {{contact.firstname}},

I wanted to follow up with some preliminary insights from the competitive analysis we started during our call.

Three quick wins we're seeing for dermatology practices in your area:

1. Patient Mix Clarity: Most derm practices aren't clearly segmenting their messaging for cosmetic vs. medical patients — which waters down both messages. We'd separate these into distinct campaigns with tailored positioning.

2. Procedure-Specific Content: Your current provider likely uses generic cosmetic messaging. We'd build credential and confidence around your specific procedures and physician expertise — which is huge for high-ticket cases.

3. Local Authority: You're not positioned as the go-to dermatology practice in your area. We'd fix that through targeted digital strategy and reputation positioning.

All of this feeds into patient acquisition and practice growth. I'd love to walk you through the full analysis — and what a 90-day roadmap looks like for {{contact.company}}.

Are you available for a deeper dive call this week?

Hi {{contact.firstname}},

I realize I haven't heard back, so I wanted to check in directly. No agenda — just want to make sure you have everything you need to move forward with a decision.

A few options:

Option 1: You're interested, and I should send over a formal proposal and investment breakdown for {{contact.company}}.

Option 2: You've got concerns or questions, and we should hop on a call to talk through them.

Option 3: It's not a fit right now, and I should stay in touch for future opportunity.
