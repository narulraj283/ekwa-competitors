We build thought leadership and patient confidence around your physicians specifically. That credibility translates to higher conversion rates and higher-value cases.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reason 3 — Speed and accountability:</strong> Ekwa partners with one dermatology practice per geography. That means you get dedicated strategy and results. No "just another client" treatment. We're invested in your success.</p>

Preview: "One thing about leaving your current provider"

Hi {{contact.firstname}},

I heard that {{contact.company}} is exploring options beyond your current marketing provider — and honestly, I think that's smart. Most generalist agencies treat dermatology like any other specialty, which is why so many derm practices struggle with the fundamentals: clearly segmenting cosmetic vs. medical messaging, positioning physician credibility, and actually attracting the patient types that move the needle on revenue.

Here's the catch: if you switch to another generalist agency, you'll run into the same problems.

Ekwa exists because dermatology is different. We specialize exclusively in medical practice marketing, and we understand the nuances of derm — the decision-making differences between cosmetic and medical patients, how to build trust around procedures, seasonal demand cycles, everything.

Before you make a move, it's worth a conversation. What's broken with your current setup?

Specialized dermatology marketing exists for a reason — because it works better. We've seen it time and time again.

Two quick questions:

2. What's your biggest pain point with your current provider? Is it patient volume, patient quality, or something else?

If we're the right fit — and I think we might be — I'd rather have this conversation now than have you go through another false start with a mediocre provider.
