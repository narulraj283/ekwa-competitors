Hi {{contact.firstname}},

It's been a minute since we last connected about the dermatology marketing strategy for {{contact.company}}. I wanted to check in and see where things stand.

Sometimes deals stall because there's an objection that didn't come up in our conversation — maybe it's budget, timeline, or uncertainty about how specialized dermatology marketing actually moves the needle on patient acquisition.

All of that is totally normal, and I'd rather address it head-on than have it slow things down.

What's the biggest question or concern on your end right now?
