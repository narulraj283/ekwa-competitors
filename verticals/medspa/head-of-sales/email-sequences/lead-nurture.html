<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

I was researching {{contact.company}} and noticed you're in the med spa space. Med spas are unique — balancing medical credibility with luxury brand positioning is tricky.

Here's what I'm curious about: Is your current marketing attracting patients who are looking for results, or is it bringing in bargain-hunters?

The reason I ask is that we work exclusively with medical practices, and I've noticed a pattern. The med spas that lead with physician credibility and medical expertise convert 2-3x better than those leading purely on the spa experience.

Ekwa specializes in positioning med spas as medical-grade, results-focused practices — not discount competitors. We handle everything from SEO to conversion-focused website design to patient journey tracking.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

Looking forward to connecting,

<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

I wanted to follow up on my last email. I mentioned something that we're seeing consistently across the med spa industry right now:

<strong>Med spas that lead with physician/medical credibility convert 2-3x better than those leading with spa experience.</strong>

This matters because patient expectations have shifted. People aren't just looking for relaxation — they want proven results backed by medical expertise. They want to trust that a board-certified provider is behind their treatment.

When your marketing emphasizes the medical foundation of your practice, it attracts higher-quality, higher-commitment patients. These are the patients who:
- Stick with treatment plans (better retention)
- Refer their friends (organic growth)
- Pay full price (less negotiation)

The opposite happens when your current marketing partner treats you like a standard spa. You attract deal-seekers, not results-seekers.

I'd love to show you examples of how Ekwa repositions med spa practices to lead with medical credibility. We've done this with dozens of practices across different specialties.

Are you open to seeing how we'd approach {{contact.company}}?

Best,

<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

This is my last message in this sequence, so I wanted to make it count.

If you've been interested in exploring how Ekwa positions med spa practices for better patient quality and higher conversions, now's the time to reach out. We're selective about which practices we work with, and my calendar fills up fast.

The practices that tend to see the biggest wins with us are those ready to make a real shift in how they market themselves — moving away from the "discount spa" positioning and toward "medical-grade results."

If that resonates with you, let's talk. If not, I respect that, and you can unsubscribe here with no hard feelings.
