<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

I noticed we weren't able to connect on our scheduled call today. No judgment — life happens. I know things get busy.

I was really looking forward to chatting about how Ekwa could help {{contact.company}} attract higher-quality patients and improve retention. It's something we've helped dozens of med spas with, and I think there's real potential here.

Are you still interested in exploring this? If so, let's find another time that works better for you. I'm flexible and can work around your schedule.

<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

Last chance to reconnect on this. I wanted to share something quickly that might be helpful.

We recently worked with another med spa similar to {{contact.company}} — great providers, solid reputation, but they weren't attracting the patient quality or volume they wanted. Their current marketing partner was treating them like a standard spa instead of the medical practice they are.

Here's what changed in the first 90 days of working with Ekwa:
- New patient inquiries increased 40%
- Higher percentage of inquiries converted to bookings
- Better patient retention and repeat visit rates
- Average patient lifetime value improved 25%

These aren't flukes. This is what happens when med spas shift from generic spa marketing to medical-grade positioning.

If you're curious about how we'd approach {{contact.company}}, I'm here. Just let me know.

If not, I understand — no hard feelings. You can unsubscribe here.

Best,
