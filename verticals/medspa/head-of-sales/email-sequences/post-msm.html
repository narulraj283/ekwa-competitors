<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

It was great meeting you at the Medical Spa Marketing conference. I enjoyed our conversation about {{contact.company}}'s growth plans, especially how you're thinking about optimizing your treatment mix and improving patient retention.

That's exactly where Ekwa specializes — helping med spas maximize the value of their existing patient base through smarter marketing and patient journey optimization.

I wanted to follow up because I think there could be some real synergies. Whether it's positioning new treatments, running seasonal promotion campaigns, or building membership programs that drive recurring revenue, these are all areas where we've helped med spas significantly improve their bottom line.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call next week to explore what a partnership with Ekwa could look like for {{contact.company}}?

Looking forward to talking more,

<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

I've been thinking about what you shared at the conference about expanding your treatment offerings. One thing we've found is that many med spas are leaving money on the table with how they position and market their services to existing patients.

Here's what I mean: Your current patient base is your most valuable asset. They've already invested in your practice. But if your marketing doesn't guide them toward higher-value treatments, they stick with what they know. You leave revenue on the table.

What if you had a system that:
- Intelligently guides patients to the treatments that match their goals
- Uses seasonal campaigns to boost demand during slower periods
- Creates membership programs that lock in recurring revenue

This is the kind of strategy we build for med spas. The results are significant — we're talking 15-30% revenue increases just by optimizing the patient journey.

Would you be interested in seeing how this could work for {{contact.company}}?

<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

I was doing some research last week, and I found something interesting: the single biggest predictor of med spa profitability isn't new patient acquisition — it's repeat patient retention.

Here's why: Med spa patients who return for multiple treatments generate 5-7x the lifetime value of a one-time patient. But here's the problem — most med spas aren't optimizing for retention. They focus all their energy on bringing in new patients, even though their existing patients are their most valuable asset.

When you combine smart retention marketing with strategic upselling (membership programs, seasonal campaigns, treatment bundles), the impact is massive.

This is a core part of how Ekwa works with med spas. We help you build systems that keep patients coming back, spending more per visit, and referring their friends.

I'd love to show you how we'd approach this for {{contact.company}}. Are you open to a call this week?

Looking forward to connecting,

<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

This is my last message for now. I wanted to reach out one more time because I genuinely believe there's something valuable we could do together for {{contact.company}}.

We're different from your current marketing partner. We don't just manage your social media or push ads. We build complete strategies around patient acquisition, retention, and lifetime value. We focus on medical positioning, conversion optimization, and patient journey tracking.

For med spas specifically, this approach tends to yield 2-3x better results than generic marketing.

If you're ready to explore what that could look like for {{contact.company}}, I'm here. Otherwise, I wish you all the best with your growth plans. You can also unsubscribe here if you'd prefer.
