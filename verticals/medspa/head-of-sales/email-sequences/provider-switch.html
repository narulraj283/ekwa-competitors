<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

I'm reaching out because I see a lot of med spas with the same problem: they've outgrown their current marketing provider.

Here's the pattern I notice: You started with a generic social media agency or digital marketing firm. They were fine at first — posting content, running ads, managing your Instagram. But as {{contact.company}} has grown, the gaps have become obvious:

- They don't understand medical marketing (regulatory, positioning, patient psychology)
- They focus on vanity metrics instead of actual conversions
- You get pretty Instagram posts but new patient inquiries stay flat
- They don't track the full patient journey or lifetime value
- They treat you like a spa, not a medical practice

Sound familiar?

The reason I'm reaching out is that we're different. Ekwa specializes exclusively in medical practices. We do SEO right. We build websites that convert. We track patient journeys. We understand how to position medical expertise without sounding stuffy.

For med spas, this difference tends to show up as 2-3x better results than generic agencies in the first 6 months.

Would you be open to a short call to see if a switch makes sense?

<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

I wanted to follow up and be specific about what makes Ekwa different from your current marketing partner.

Most agencies — even those calling themselves "medical marketing specialists" — don't actually specialize. They manage medical clients like they manage everyone else.

Here's what Ekwa does differently for med spas:

<strong>SEO:</strong> We build medical-grade SEO. This means optimizing for patient intent (people searching for treatments, results, credentials). Your current agency probably focuses on volume. We focus on quality.

<strong>Website Design:</strong> We build conversion-focused sites that educate patients and build trust. Not just pretty brochures. Patients should feel like they understand the medical foundation of what you do.

<strong>Patient Journey Tracking:</strong> Most agencies don't track patients from first click to booking. We do. This lets us see exactly what's working and what's not, and optimize constantly.

<strong>Medical Positioning:</strong> We position your practice as medical-first, luxury-second. This attracts better patients and justifies higher prices.

<strong>Retention Strategy:</strong> We build systems to keep patients coming back and spending more. Not just acquisition focus.

This is why switching from a generic agency to Ekwa typically results in 2-3x better outcomes for med spas.

<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

One thing I hear from med spas considering switching agencies: "Isn't the transition complicated?"

Not really. Here's how it typically works:

<strong>Week 1-2:</strong> We do a full audit of your current marketing setup (website, SEO, analytics, etc.). We identify gaps and quick wins.

<strong>Week 3-4:</strong> We present a 90-day plan showing exactly what we'd change, why, and what results we expect.

<strong>Months 2-3:</strong> We implement. We handle all the technical stuff. Your current agency gradually hands off.

Most practices are shocked at how smooth the transition is. And even more shocked at the results we deliver in months 3-6.

The best time to make a switch is when you're intentional about it. Not when you're frustrated, but because you have a clear vision of where you want to go.

I think {{contact.company}} is ready for that next level. Are you interested in exploring it?

Let me know and we can get started.
