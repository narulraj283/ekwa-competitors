<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

I know we've been in conversations about Ekwa for a bit, and things may have slowed down on your end — that's totally normal. Decisions like this take time, especially when you're balancing a busy practice.

I didn't want to disappear. Instead, I thought I'd add some real value while we figure out next steps.

I've put together a quick analysis of what's working for top-performing med spas in 2026. It covers:
- How the best med spas position themselves (medical vs. spa-first messaging)
- The treatment mix strategies that drive 20%+ revenue increases
- How patient retention programs lock in recurring revenue

This is based on our work with dozens of practices. I think you'll find it useful even if we don't move forward together.

Interested? I can send it over today.

                <strong>Subject:</strong> How another med spa like yours increased revenue 30% in 6 months
            </div>

            <div class="email-body">
<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

I wanted to share something specific because I think it applies directly to what you're trying to accomplish at {{contact.company}}.

One of our clients — a med spa with a similar profile to yours — was in a plateau. Good practice, good reputation, but they weren't growing fast enough. Their current marketing partner (generic agency) was treating them like a standard aesthetic business, not a medical practice.

Here's what changed when they switched to Ekwa:

<strong>First 90 days:</strong>
- New patient inquiries up 45%
- Conversion rate improved (better quality patients asking the right questions)
- Website became a patient education tool, not just a booking form

<strong>By 6 months:</strong>
- Treatment mix optimization increased average patient value by 22%
- Membership programs created predictable recurring revenue
- Repeat patient rate improved from 35% to 58%
- Overall revenue up 30%

This wasn't luck. This was because we positioned them as a medical practice first, luxury experience second. We built systems around patient retention and lifetime value.

I believe we could do something similar for {{contact.company}}. The question is: are you ready to make the shift?

<strong>Hi {{contact.firstname}},</strong>

This is my last outreach on this for now. I wanted to be direct about what I think is happening.

You're a good operator — {{contact.company}} is solid. But I suspect you're frustrated because your marketing isn't reflecting the quality of what you're doing. Generic agencies don't understand med spas. They treat you like a spa instead of a medical practice, and your results suffer.

Ekwa is different. We specialize in medical practices. We understand positioning, patient psychology, retention strategy, and revenue optimization. We'd approach {{contact.company}} differently, and the results would show.

If you're ready to explore what that looks like, I'm available. If you're happy with where things are, I totally respect that. You can unsubscribe below with no hard feelings.

My door is open if you change your mind.
