                    <p>I'll be direct: I've been looking forward to partnering with {{contact.company}}, but I need to understand where things stand.</p>
                    <p>Are you:</p>
                    <p><strong>A) Still interested, but need more time?</strong><br>
                    That's fine—we can work around your timeline. Just give me a date, and we'll schedule a follow-up conversation.</p>
                    <p><strong>B) Leaning toward working with your current provider?</strong><br>
                    I respect that. Just know that we work differently—exclusively with surgeons, not multi-specialty firms. The difference shows up in the results.</p>
                    <p><strong>C) Decided to pass?</strong><br>
                    No hard feelings. But before you close the door, I'd love a 10-minute call to understand what the hesitation is. Maybe we can address it.</p>
                    <p>Your practice deserves marketing that reflects your expertise and board certifications. If that's not with us, I hope it's with someone who takes that seriously.</p>
                    <p>Let me know—what's next?</p>

                    <strong>Sequence Note:</strong> If no response after this email, move to stalled deal sequence (longer cadence: Days 1, 14, 30). If marked "not interested," consider moving to provider switch sequence if there are signals they're working with a multi-industry agency.

I'll be direct: I've been looking forward to partnering with {{contact.company}}, but I need to understand where things stand.

Are you:

A) Still interested, but need more time?
That's fine—we can work around your timeline. Just give me a date, and we'll schedule a follow-up conversation.

B) Leaning toward working with your current provider?
I respect that. Just know that we work differently—exclusively with surgeons, not multi-specialty firms. The difference shows up in the results.

C) Decided to pass?
No hard feelings. But before you close the door, I'd love a 10-minute call to understand what the hesitation is. Maybe we can address it.

Your practice deserves marketing that reflects your expertise and board certifications. If that's not with us, I hope it's with someone who takes that seriously.

Let me know—what's next?
