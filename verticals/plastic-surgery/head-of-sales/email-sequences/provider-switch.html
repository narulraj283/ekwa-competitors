I'm reaching out because I noticed {{contact.company}} is working with a general marketing agency, and I wanted to share something we're seeing across the board.

Here's the reality: agencies that work across multiple industries—dental, dermatology, urgent care, plastic surgery, cosmetic practices—have to treat your practice like everything else. And that's the problem.

Plastic surgery marketing is not the same as medical practice marketing in general. You need:

• Someone who understands before-and-after photography standards and regulations
• Expertise in HIPAA-compliant patient testimonials and case studies
• Knowledge of board certification prominence and how to showcase it
• Understanding of cosmetic surgery patient psychology and messaging

Most multi-industry agencies can't deliver on these. They treat your practice like they treat a dentist or urgent care clinic. The results show.

Ekwa is different. We work exclusively in medical specialties, with a deep focus on plastic surgery. We've built our entire approach around surgeons like you.

If you're open to a conversation about what that difference could mean for {{contact.company}}, let's talk.

Following up on my last email. I want to be more specific about what we're seeing.

Surgeons working with your current provider (and agencies like them) consistently report the same frustrations:

"Our credentials don't get top billing." When your marketing partner manages 50+ different types of practices, your unique value proposition gets buried. Board certification should be a cornerstone of your messaging. It rarely is.

"Before-and-after galleries are afterthoughts." Agencies without plastic surgery specialization don't know how to leverage your best asset—visible patient outcomes. They treat photos like supplementary content.

"We're just another practice to them." Multi-industry agencies have to standardize everything. Your specialized knowledge and surgical approach can't compete with their template approach.

At Ekwa, we have one focus: positioning board-certified surgeons and their outcomes as the centerpiece of digital presence. Not templates. Not one-size-fits-all. Your credentials. Your skill. Your results.

The surgeons we work with see the difference within 60-90 days.

Worth exploring?
