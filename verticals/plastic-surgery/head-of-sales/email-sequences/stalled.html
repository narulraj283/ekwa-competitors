It's been a couple of weeks, and I wanted to check in.

I know things get hectic when you're managing a surgical practice. Between patient consultations, OR schedules, and everything else, digital strategy can take a backseat—even when you know it's important.

That said, I still believe there's a real opportunity for {{contact.company}} here. The gap between your surgical excellence and your online presence is still there, and every day that gap exists, you're likely losing qualified patient leads.

Our approach is straightforward: we position board-certified surgeons and their outcomes as the centerpiece of digital presence. Not generic wellness messaging. Not multi-specialty approach. Just your credentials, your skill, your results.

If you're ready to revisit this, I'm here. If not yet, totally understand—I'll check back in a few weeks.

Either way, let me know.

The surgeons pulling in the most qualified patient leads are the ones making a deliberate choice to own their digital presence. They're not relying on reviews or word-of-mouth alone. They're showcasing their credentials, their training, their board certifications prominently. And their before-and-after galleries? They're a centerpiece, not a side note.

That specialization is the difference. And it shows in patient acquisition.
